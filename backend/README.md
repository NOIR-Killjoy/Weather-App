# Weather App Backend

This is the backend service for the Weather App, built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It provides weather data, air quality index (AQI), and local news updates to the frontend.

## Features

- **Weather Data API** – Fetches real-time weather details including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Probability of rain
  - Sunset time
- **Local News Integration** – Provides relevant local news updates.
- **Optimized Data Handling** – Efficient API calls with caching mechanisms.
- **Secure API Handling** – Request validation and error handling for robustness.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Axios** (for API requests)
- **Dotenv** (for environment variables)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Steps to Set Up the Backend
